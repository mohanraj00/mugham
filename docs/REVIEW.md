# Review and merge rules

These rules apply to every change to `main`. [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) owns the general workflow.

## Protected main

- Every change goes through a pull request. Direct pushes, force pushes and branch deletion are blocked.
- A PR needs one approval from a code owner. A new push removes earlier approvals.
- The required checks are `ci-ok`, `cross-review`, `security-review` and `acceptance`. The shared gates of `mohanraj00/.github` supply the last three. `.github/workflows/gates.yml` pins the gates action to a full commit SHA.
- The maintainer is the only code owner. GitHub does not let an author approve their own PR, so the maintainer merges their own PRs with the admin bypass. The cross-harness review below replaces the approval for these PRs.

## Human contributors

A contributor does not need Codex, Claude Code or agy. [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) gives the steps. For a PR without a harness, the maintainer asks for the code review and the security review as the sections below show. If no harness is available, the maintainer does a manual code review, as the local fallback section says.

## Cross-harness review

A harness does not review its own change. The branch prefix names the harness that wrote the change: `claude/`, `codex/` or `agy/`. The reviews run on GitHub. No harness reviews a PR by default, so the PR author asks in a PR comment.

| Builder | Code review comment | Security review comment |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `@codex review` | `@codex security review` |
| Codex | `@claude review this PR. Use the Review guidelines in AGENTS.md.` | `@codex security review` |
| agy | `@claude review this PR. Use the Review guidelines in AGENTS.md.` | `@codex security review` |

The Codex security review is the first choice for each builder. If Codex is not available, ask for the Claude security review with this exact text: `@claude do a security review of this PR. Use the Review guidelines in AGENTS.md.` A Claude security review is advisory, as the [Security review](#security-review) section says.

Follow these rules for each request:

1. Ask when CI is green and the PR is ready.
2. For a Codex code review request, write `Head: <sha>` on the next line of the comment. Use the short SHA of the PR head commit. Do not add this line to a Claude request. The Claude review starts only for the exact text in the table, and its comment names the head that it reviewed.
3. Write a security review request as the exact text in the table, with no other text in the comment. If the comment has other text, for example a `Head:` line, Codex does a code review and no security review. The Codex result names the commit that it reviewed.
4. Ask one time for each head commit. Before you ask, read the PR comments. If a request names the current head, or comes after the last push, do not ask again.
5. If you push fixes after a review, ask again for the new head. Ask at most 3 times for each PR. After that, ask the maintainer to review. The `gate` job of the Claude review stops a second Claude review of one kind for a head. It also stops a Claude review after 3 of one kind.
6. Fix each real finding, or write on the PR why it is not a defect. For a finding in the gates, use the stop rule of the [standard](STANDARD.md). The gates are the files of `mohanraj00/.github` and their copies in this project. Do not change a copy. File the finding in `mohanraj00/.github`.

The `cross-review` check passes only for a review of the current head from the other harness. A Claude-built PR needs a completed Codex code review. A Codex-built or agy-built PR needs a Claude review marker with `findings=0`. If the review came from the agy fallback or from the maintainer, the maintainer adds the `cross-reviewed` label. The label counts only with an approval record for the current head and base.

Codex reviews through the Codex GitHub integration. Claude Code reviews through the [Claude review](../.github/workflows/claude-review.yml) workflow. The workflow starts only if all of these are true:

- The comment is on a PR.
- The comment body is exactly one of the two Claude request texts in the table. GitHub compares these texts with no regard to letter case.
- The commenter is an owner, a member or a collaborator.

A comment or a review with other text does not start the workflow. The comment text selects one of two fixed prompts, and it never goes into a prompt.

### Claude review design

An issue comment event reads the workflow from `main`, so a PR cannot change this workflow for its own review. The workflow has three jobs. A concurrency group for each PR makes the requests on one PR run one at a time. A new pending request replaces an older pending request, and the older request posts no comment.

The `gate` job runs first, with no environment and no secret. It runs the `claude-review` check of the gates action, at the same SHA as the gates. It has `actions: read`, `contents: read`, `issues: read` and `pull-requests: read` only. It stops the request for these reasons:

- The PR is from a fork, and it has no stage 2 owner approval of the current head and base. The check uses the same code as `acceptance`.
- A trusted marker of the same kind names the current head and merge base.
- The PR has 3 trusted markers of the same kind.

On a pass, the `gate` job gives the head, the base and the merge base to the `review` job.

The `review` job has `contents: read` and `pull-requests: read` only. It uses the `claude-review` environment, which holds the `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` secret. Only the CLI step gets the secret. The environment needs a deployment branch rule for `main`. The job does these steps:

1. It starts only after the `gate` job passes. It checks out `main` and fetches the PR commits as Git objects only. It never checks out PR files, so the PR cannot supply instructions, settings or code.
2. It reads the base branch of the PR from the API and fetches it. It writes the diff with `git diff --no-ext-diff --no-textconv -U20 pr/base...pr/head`. If the diff is empty, the job fails. If the head, the base or the merge base is not the one that the `gate` job approved, the job fails. This can occur after a push while the environment waits for approval. Then ask again.
3. It installs one exact version of the Claude Code CLI and checks the SHA-512 value of the package.
4. It runs the CLI in restricted mode with only the `Read`, `Grep` and `Glob` tools, no MCP server, no slash command and a turn limit. These tools cannot read `/proc`. The prompt says that the diff is untrusted data.
5. It checks the JSON result: `type` is `result`, `subtype` is `success`, `is_error` is false, `result` is not empty and `permission_denials` is empty. If a check fails, the job fails.
6. It keeps the review text and the head SHA in an artifact.

The `post` job has `contents: read`, `issues: write` and `pull-requests: write` only, with no secret and no environment. A comment on a PR needs `pull-requests: write`. It runs [tools/claude_review.py](../tools/claude_review.py) from the `main` checkout. This file is a copy of `gates/claude_review.py` of `mohanraj00/.github`. The comment starts with a fixed marker: `<!-- claude-review:v2 kind=<code|security> head=<sha> base=<sha> findings=<count|unknown> run=<run id> -->`. The script writes the marker outside the model text. `base` is the merge base of the base branch and the head, where the diff of the review starts. The count comes from the first line of the model text, `Findings: <number>`. If that line is not valid, the count is `unknown`. If the `review` job failed, the comment holds only `NO VALID CLAUDE REVIEW` and the head SHA. If the `gate` job stopped the request, the comment gives the reason of the `gate` job.

The `post` job writes as the workflow bot, and the gates trust approval records and review markers from this bot. Thus the script treats the model text as untrusted. The model text cannot make a marker or an approval record. It escapes `&` and `<`, changes each `@` to a character that makes no mention, and limits the length.

### Use of a Claude result

The `cross-review` gate reads the marker. It accepts a marker only from an `issue_comment` run of this workflow on the default branch, for the current head and merge base, with `findings=0`. It does not accept a `v1` marker, because that marker names no base. A new commit on the base branch does not change the merge base, so the review stays valid. If the base branch of the PR changes, ask for a new Claude review. The marker gives `findings=unknown` if the review text does not agree with the count on its first line:

- `INCOMPLETE REVIEW` is on a line below the first line.
- A later `Findings: N` line gives a different count.
- The count is 0, and a later line starts with a severity tag or a `path:line` reference.
- The count is 0, and a severity tag P0 to P3 is at any position in a later line.

The check reads the text in NFKC form with no format characters. It does not find prose that describes a defect with no severity tag and no `path:line` reference. A Claude security marker is advisory. The `security-review` gate writes a line about it, but it does not pass for it. A person also reads the text. The review has no inline comments and no conversation. A push makes a new head, so ask again as the request rules say. The OAuth token is a static secret. If you suspect a leak, revoke it and make a new one.

### Local fallback: agy

If the GitHub reviewer is not available (no quota, an outage or no integration), run agy on your machine:

```sh
python3 -B tools/cross_review.py --work "$REVIEW_WORK"
```

Post the report on the PR. It starts with `Review (agy <version>):` and names the base and head commits. If agy is not available, ask the maintainer for a manual review. If the PR needs a security review, the maintainer also does a manual security review, as the [Security review](#security-review) section says.

The PR is untrusted input to agy:

- agy runs headless and with `--sandbox` in an empty directory. It gets a new HOME that holds only its login token and an empty allow list. Thus, your global agy allow rules and MCP servers do not apply, and the PR cannot supply settings or instruction files.
- The prompt quotes `CONSTITUTION.md` and `AGENTS.md` from the base revision, not from the PR.
- agy gets only basic environment variables and its own login key. The script also sets `SSH_CONNECTION`. If agy finds an SSH session, it uses only the file token and does not open the macOS keychain. agy does not document this behavior, so the script checks the agy log (`<work>/<kind>/agy.log`). The script needs a file token at `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/antigravity-oauth-token` or an API key. If it has neither, it stops before agy starts. The report gives a warning if agy did not use file-only storage, or if agy changed the refresh token. agy output never changes your token file. Read the report before you post it, and remove anything that is not a review finding.
- The tool resolves the base and head to commit SHAs once. If HEAD changes during the review, the report says so and the tool exits 1.
- If the diff is larger than 90000 bytes, the tool cuts it and says so in the report. Get a manual review of the rest.
- The full output and exit status stay in the work directory, which must be outside the checkout.

## Security review

The gates action owns the shared security categories. [.github/gates.json](../.github/gates.json) adds the project paths. The list includes the workflows, the tools, the source of the kit and the workbench, and the agent instruction files. The renderer, the action path and the offline queue are boundaries.

If a PR changes one of these paths, the `security-review` check fails until the current head has a security review with no open finding. A move counts both its old and new path. Agent instruction files and settings count at any directory depth. To pass the check:

1. Ask for the security review in a PR comment, as the table above shows.
2. Fix each finding, push, and ask again for the new head.
3. If the Codex security review of the current head finds no security issues, the check passes. You do not add a label.
4. A Claude security review is advisory. If it finds no security issues, the maintainer reads it and adds the `security-reviewed` label.

The security review of `mohanraj00/.github` covers the copies of its files. Thus the `security-review` check passes with no review for these changes, after it proves each one:

- an exact copy of a file of `mohanraj00/.github` at the new pin;
- a change of only the SHA in a pin line of the gates action, if the new SHA is on `main` of `mohanraj00/.github`.

The copy check reads the old pin from `.github/workflows/gates.yml` of the base branch. Each other listed change still needs a review. A repin PR stays level 1.

The [Gates rerun](../.github/workflows/gates-rerun.yml) workflow starts the failed gate again when Codex posts a result, or when the Claude review workflow completes. If the gate run is in progress, the workflow waits for it to complete. GitHub keeps the failed attempt in the run history. The gate trusts only results that the Codex app posts, and only for the commit that the result names. A push makes a new head, so the gate needs a new result. A result names a commit, not a base. Thus, the gate ignores results posted before the last change of the PR base branch. A clean result is a model output, not a proof. A PR can contain text that tries to steer the reviewer. If a change looks wrong to you, do not merge it.

The `security-reviewed` label is only for the cases that a clean Codex result cannot show:

- The review came from the Claude review workflow. Its result is advisory.
- Codex is not available, and the review came from the agy fallback: `python3 -B tools/cross_review.py --security yes --work "$REVIEW_WORK"`. Post the report.
- A finding is not a defect, and the PR has an answer for it.
- Codex and agy are both not available, and the maintainer did a manual security review. The maintainer posts the review on the PR. The review names the head commit and the base commit, and gives each finding with its fix or its answer.

In these cases, the maintainer adds the `security-reviewed` label. The label records a fact: the current head has a security review, and each finding has a fix or an answer. It is not a separate review. When the maintainer adds the label, the workflow posts an approval record with the PR head and base at that time. The label counts only while the PR has that head and base. After a push or a base change, the next run removes the label.

The `Gates` workflow uses the `pull_request_target` event. GitHub runs that workflow from the base branch. It checks out the base SHA, so `.github/gates.json` and the PR template come from the base branch, and a PR cannot change its own gate. The gates action comes from a pinned SHA. The workflow reads only the PR file list, the labels, its own approval records and the review results. It never checks out or runs the PR head. Do not change this.

The workflow posts the approval records with the workflow token. A fork PR gets a read-only token, so it cannot write a record. A user with write access can change a workflow to write one, so the gates trust writers.

## PRs from forks

GitHub does not run workflows for a PR from an outside contributor until a maintainer approves the run. Before you approve the run, read the workflow and tool changes. Do not approve a run that changes `.github/` or `tools/` until you understand the change.

The `acceptance` check fails for a fork PR until these conditions are true:

- The PR links an open issue in this repository. That issue has the `accepted` label from an admin, and it does not have the `decision` label.
- The PR has the owner approval of the current head and base.
- If the PR changes protected paths, the PR also has the `accepted` label for the current head and base.

Each label on the PR counts only for the head and base that it names, as for the security label.

The owner approval is one of these:

- the `ready-for-review` label, with its approval record;
- an approval with the GitHub Approve button. The latest review of each user counts, and a dismissed review does not count. A review does not start the gates, so run the failed `acceptance` job again, for example with `gh run rerun <run-id> --failed`.

Ask for a review of a fork PR only after the owner approval. Before this approval, the `gate` job stops a Claude review of a fork PR. Before you add the `accepted` label, make sure that:

- the PR links an issue with a concrete workflow and completion criteria;
- the catalog, the examples and the tests name no real product, brand, customer or person;
- the change contains no private application material, credentials, customer data or generated binaries, other than the README screenshots in `docs/screenshots/`;
- the change adds no runtime dependency to the kit, or the owner approved it;
- the PR keeps the Apache-2.0 terms;
- the cross-harness review and, if needed, the security review are posted.

If the contributor pushes again, read the new commits before you approve the run. Then give the owner approval and add the label again, because they count only for the earlier head.

## CI scope

The `CI` workflow uses the `ci-ok` skeleton of the shared gates. It runs the `shared-project` job on every PR and every push to `main`. That job runs the project check. The `shared-gates` job runs the gate regression tests of the pinned gates action.

The project has no source code yet. When the kit has source, add a `suite` job for each change that is not docs-only. The `changes` job reads `.github/gates.json` from the base branch. A code, security-relevant or level 1 path is not docs. The `ci-ok` job passes if each needed job passed or was skipped.

The `CI` workflow uses the `pull_request` event and runs the PR code without secrets. Thus a PR can change its own CI scope. The trusted `security-review` gate covers this: a change to `.github/` or `tools/` needs a security review.
